# ML-at-the-Edge

Repository that explores Machine Learning on resource constrained devices. It explores some key concepts in ML, by implementing various ML models for activity recognition (and other applications), then taking a look at how these model complexities need to be optimized in order to run inference on microcontrollers, with techniques such as quantization, and libraries such as CMSIS-NN. 

Base code is from Arm education: Getting Started with Machine Learning at the Edge on Arm, with personal contributions and insights. Interest is focused on the model optimization portion, but earlier modules on ML model implementation serve as a refresher course
