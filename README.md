# ML-at-the-Edge

Repository that explores Machine Learning on resource constrained devices. It explores some key concepts in ML, by implementing various ML models for activity recognition (and other applications), then taking a look at how these model complexities need to be optimized in order to run inference on microcontrollers, with techniques such as quantization, and libraries such as CMSIS-NN. 

Base code is from Arm education: Getting Started with Machine Learning at the Edge on Arm, with additional contributions and comments
